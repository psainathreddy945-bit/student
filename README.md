# Stock Trading Platform - Java OOP Project

## Overview
This is a complete Stock Trading Platform built with Java and Swing GUI. It demonstrates advanced OOP concepts including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. The platform allows users to buy/sell stocks, track their portfolio, and view transaction history.

- ✅ Calculate portfolio value and profit/loss
- ✅ Display transaction history
- ✅ File handling for persistence

### OOP Concepts Implemented
- **Encapsulation**: Private variables with public getters/setters
- **Inheritance**: Base classes with derived functionality
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden methods and interfaces
- **Collections**: HashMap, ArrayList for data management
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks for error management

### File Handling
- **transactions.txt**: Stores all buy/sell transactions

## How to Run in VS Code

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed
- VS Code with Extension Pack for Java

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Install Java Extension Pack
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Extension Pack for Java"
4. Click "Install"

#### Step 2: Create Workspace Folder
1. Create a new folder: `C:\Intern` (or your preferred location)
2. Open this folder in VS Code

#### Step 3: Copy All Java Files
1. Copy all the provided Java files to the `C:\Intern` folder:
   - Stock.java
   - User.java
   - Portfolio.java
   - Transaction.java
   - FileManager.java
   - MainFrame.java
   - Main.java

#### Step 4: Compile the Project
Open Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`) and run:

```bash
# Navigate to project folder (if not already there)
cd C:\Intern

# Compile all Java files
javac *.java
```

If you see no errors, compilation is successful!

#### Step 5: Run the Application
In the terminal, run:

```bash
java Main
```

The Stock Trading Platform GUI should launch!

#### Alternative: Run Directly from VS Code
1. Open `Main.java`
2. You should see a "Run" link above the `public static void main` method
3. Click "Run" to execute

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "javac is not recognized"**
- Add Java to your system PATH
- Or provide full path to Java: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-xx\bin\javac *.java`

**Error: "Cannot find symbol"**
- Make sure all Java files are in the same folder
- Check file names match exactly
- Recompile all files: `javac *.java`

**Error: "Exception in thread main"**
- Check that Main.java exists and is properly named
- Ensure all files are compiled

**GUI doesn't appear**
- Check terminal for error messages
- Ensure Swing components are supported on your system
- Try running with: `java -Dswing.systemlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel Main`
